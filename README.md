# MAME Reproducible CHDs

In an interest to make MAMEâ€™s preinstalled/preconfigured hard disk
CHDs reproducible based on original installation media, this
repository contains and documents INP replay files and how to build
the desired image.

By making these reproducible, downstream users have a chance to
witness how the CHDs are made in the first place and whether any
modifications happened to the operating system during the process.
